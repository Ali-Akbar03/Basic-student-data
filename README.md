Input Collection:
1.	Called  import java.util.Scanner; for user input.
2.	The program takes input using a Scanner object for the student's name, ID, age, fee, and grade.
3.	Every System.out.print statement prompts the user for the said information.
4.	For taking the grade input, scanner.next().charAt(0) is used to receive a single character since next() receives the input as a string.
Output:
The entered details are displayed using System.out.println statements,
which print the student's details in a human-readable format.
Closing the Scanner:
After reading the inputs, the scanner.close() is called to release the
resources occupied by the scanner object.
